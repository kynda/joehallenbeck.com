Work Experience
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Developer,** Fullbay, Phoenix, AZ 12/2018 -- Present

-   Worked in a fast-growing SAAS start up serving the heavy-duty
    equipment repair industry. Scaled team from two to over a dozen
    individual contributors in the first year while introducing Agile
    principles, git-flow, and test-driven development.
-   Presented internal talks on test-driven development, unit test
    design, application security (OWASP Top Ten) and the PHP Standards
    Recommendations (PSR).
-   Mentored junior developers through constructive code reviews,
    pairing, code walks throughs, and documentation.
-   Migrated early back-end MVP written in a custom PHP5 framework to
    PHP8+ using the Larval 10 framework.
-   Paired with external partners to co-develop interoperable REST and
    event-driven APIs that coordinated client services in processing
    invoices, alerting partners of workflow events, and GPS coordinates
    of on-site technicians.
-   Implemented point of sale software that processed \$2+ million
    monthly card terminal, card-not-present, ACH, and fleet check
    transactions through multiple payment processors (WorldPay, Payrix,
    Authorize.net, Stripe, and RoadSync).
-   Developed an event-based system that notified customers of workflow
    progress through emails, pop-ups, and text messages (via Twilio).
-   Used AWS services (Cloud Formation, Lambda, SNS, SQS) and Nodejs to
    create an event-based routing system allowing for concurrent and
    "eventually consistent" operations to be offloaded from the main
    client-facing server and onto a distribution of services.
-   Automated deployment of test and development sandboxes by
    containerizing our services using Docker.

**Software Engineer,** Research Square, Durham, NC 1/2015 -- 11/2018

-   Supported legacy software and new feature development of an
    enterprise Zend Framework PHP application responsible for directing
    workflows and task assignment for a team of 300+ remote editors and
    translators
-   Spearheaded project to migrate 500,000 invoices from an internally
    built accounting suite to ZohoBooks. Evaluated potential external
    accounting suites for suitability. Maintained record integrity of
    new transactions while actively migrating existing records.
-   Refactored a 1.4 million line monolithic PHP application into
    smaller business contexts through the application of Domain Driven
    Design principles to create a hexagonal event-driven architecture.
-   Practiced Scrum-based project management, management, unit testing,
    code reviews, and pairing to maintain team cohesion and project
    success

**Developer,** 44Interactive, Sioux Falls, SD 1/2013 -- 12/2014

-   Developed a bespoke e-commerce platform using Laraval that featured
    inventory management, shopping carts, and credit card transactions
    through Authorize.net. Clients included local golf courses and
    country clubs who used our cart to process annual club memberships
    and tee-times.
-   Completed the front-end development of and launched over 80 client
    websites. Front-end work included vanilla Javascript development of
    HTML5 drawing tools, interacting with API back-ends, and interfacing
    with Facebook, Google, and Cakemail APIs.
-   Increased production system up-time from 97% to 99.99% on a server
    that saw 50k+ unique visitors per day and reduced server costs by
    50%

**Developer,** Gage E-Services, Sioux Falls, SD 7/2011 -- 1/2013
